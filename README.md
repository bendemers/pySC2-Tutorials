# Idea
As a part of my indpendent study program at school I challenged myself to try and create the best StarCraft II AI I could in just one quater this year as a lead up to starting the Halite III challenge in November. As a player I thought it would be easy because I can beat out the AI so why couldn't my bot. This proved not to be the case as I struggled to get the bot past just mining minerals and producing Marines. However, I am proud of how well the bot can handle micro movements and combat. Future changes to add would be other races, air power, and better understanding of the map
